Introduction
============
This framework is intended to simply making agi applications. You will 
extend PAGIApplication and your signal handler, error handler, init, and
shutdown methods are automatically setup and called.

For an in-depth tutorial: http://marcelog.github.com/articles/pagi_tutorial_create_voip_telephony_application_for_asterisk_with_agi_and_php.html

An example IVR application that includes unit tests is available here: https://github.com/marcelog/Pagi-App-And-Test-Example

Checkout the api (phpdoc) at: http://ci.marcelog.name:8080/job/PAGI/javadoc/

Please see docs/examples/quickstart for a very basic example. You'll need
something like this in your dialplan:

[default]
exten => 1,1,AGI(/tmp/PAGI/docs/examples/quickstart/run.sh,a,b,c,d)
exten => 1,n,Hangup

FastAGI
-------
You can use FastPAGI if you want to launch your applications using 
FastAGI: https://github.com/marcelog/FastPAGI

Currently there is no manual or comprehensive documentation, so please refer
to the examples, it's really all there (I will write the documentation as
soon as possible). Please contact me if you have any comments, doubts, or
any kind of feedback. Send an email to: marcelog@gmail.com

You may want to take a look at Ding https://github.com/marcelog/Ding if you're
interested in using DI, AOP, and other stuff in your telephony applications.

Note: The client accepts an array with options. The available options are:

log4php.properties => Optional. If set, should contain the absolute path to the
                      log4php.properties file.
stdin => Optional. If set, should contain an already open stream from where the
         client will read data (useful to make it interact with fastagi servers
         or even text files to mock stuff when testing). If not set, stdin will
         be used by the client.
stdout => Optional. Same as stdin but for the output of the client.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CI Server
---------
Take a look at the Jenkins CI Server (http://ci.marcelog.name/) to check out the
docs, metrics, and pear and phar packages available.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Available via PEAR
------------------
You can now easily install PAGI by issuing:
# pear channel-discover pear.marcelog.name
# pear install marcelog/PAGI

or

# pear install marcelog/PAGI-1.10.4
just replace 1.10.4 by the release version you'd like to install :)
See: http://pear.marcelog.name/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing IVR applications
========================
A mocked pagi client is included to easily test your ivr applications. See
docs/examples/mock to see an example of how to use it.

Another example can be found at: https://github.com/marcelog/Pagi-App-And-Test-Example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nodes
=====
For a tutorial about nodes, see this article: http://marcelog.github.com/articles/pagi_node_call_flow_easy_telephony_application_for_asterisk_php.html
Simple Call Flow Nodes are available (see docs/examples/node/example.php). Using
nodes will let you simplify how you build and test your ivr applications. Nodes
are an abstraction layer above the pagi client, and support:
 * Prompts mixing sound files, playing numbers/digits/datetime's.
 * Cancel and End Of Input digits.
 * Validator callbacks for inputs, can optionally specify 1 or more sound files
 to play when the validation fails.
 * Callbacks for invalid and valid inputs.
 * Optional sound when no input.
 * Maximum valid input attempts.
 * Optional sound when maximum attempts has been reached.
 * Expecting at least/at most/exactly N digits per input.
 * Timeout between digits in more-than-1 digit inputs.
 * Timeout per input attempt.
 * Retry Attempts for valid inputs.
 * And much more!

The NodeController will let you control the call flow of your application, by
registering nodes and actions based on node results. Thus, you can jump from
one node to the other on cancel or complete inputs, hangup the call, execute a
callback, etc. For an example, see docs/examples/nodecontroller/example.php

An article about the node controller is available at:
http://marcelog.github.com/articles/making_your_ivr_nodes_call_flow_with_pagi_and_php_asterisk.html
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AutoDial
========
CallFiles are supported. You can also schedule a call in the future.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fax
===
Sending and receiving faxes is supported using spandsp (applications SendFax
and ReceiveFax).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Available Facades
=================
PAGI\Client\CDR: Provided to access cdr variables.
PAGI\Client\ChannelVariables: Provided to access channel variables and asterisk
environment variables.
PAGI\Client\CallerID: Provided to access caller id variables.
PAGI\Client\Result: Provided to wrap up the result for agi commands.
PAGI\CallSpool\CallFile: Call file facade.
PAGI\CallSpool\CallSpool: Call spool facade.
PAGI\Logger\Asterisk: Provides access to asterisk logger (see logger.conf in your
asterisk installation).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Results
=======
For every operation, a Result is provided. Some operations decorate this
Result to add functionality, like PlayResult, ReadResult, etc. For example,
a stream file will return a PlayResult, which decorates a ReadResult which 
in turn, decorated a Result.
* PAGI\Client\DialResult
* PAGI\Client\ExecResult
* PAGI\Client\ReadResult
* PAGI\Client\PlayResult
* PAGI\Client\FaxResult
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debugging, logging
==================

You need log4php (http://logging.apache.org/log4php/). Just make sure you
copy it to the include_path and PAGI will pick it up from there (the 
directory src/main/php is the one that needs to be in the include_path).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developers
==========
* build.xml is a phing build file, not ant.
* It's very possible that you may need to edit build.properties.
* Available main targets: all, build, test, report.
* Tools run: phpdoc, phploc, phpcs, phpmd, phpcpd, phpdepend, phpunit.
* Setup your installation by editing pear and php paths in build.properties
* Run phing install-dependencies this will install pear and everything needed
to run ding tests and metrics.
* Run phing all
* Check the API at http://marcelog.github.com/PAGI/api.html
