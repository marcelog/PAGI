Contributing
============

We are open to contributions to the PAGI code. If you find a bug or want to contribute, just
follow these steps:

- Fork [the PAGI repository](https://github.com/marcelog/PAGI) on github.

- Make your feature addition or bug fix.

- Add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally.

- Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
